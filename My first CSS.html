<h2>Zebrafish</h2>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<h4>Range</h4>
<p>
    The zebrafish is native to fresh water habitats in South Asia where it is found in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
    Nepal and Bhutan.[1][10][11][12] The northern limit is in the South Himalayas, ranging from the Sutlej river basin
    in the Pakistan–India border region to the state of Arunachal Pradesh in northeast Indian.[1][11] Its range is
    concentrated in the Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins, and the species was first described from Kosi River (lower
    Ganges basin) of India. Its range further south is more local, with scattered records from the Western and Eastern
    Ghats regions.[12][13][14] It has frequently been said to occur in Myanmar (Burma), but this is entirely based on
    pre-1930 records and likely refers to close relatives only described later, notably Danio kyathit.[12][15][16][17]
    Likewise, old[clarification needed] records from Sri Lanka are highly questionable and remain unconfirmed

<h4>Habitats</h4>
<p>
    Zebrafish typically inhabit moderately flowing to stagnant clear water of quite shallow depth in streams, canals,
    ditches, oxbow lakes, ponds and rice paddies.[12][13][19][20] There is usually some vegetation, either submerged or
    overhanging from the banks, and the bottom is sandy, muddy or silty, often mixed with pebbles or gravel.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The zebrafish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal, blue stripes on the side of the body, which are
    reminiscent of a zebra's stripes, and which extend to the end of the caudal fin. Its shape is fusiform and laterally
    compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. The male is torpedo-shaped, with gold stripes between the blue stripes;
    the female has a larger, whitish belly and silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females exhibit a small genital
    papilla in front of the anal fin origin. The zebrafish can reach up to 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in) in length,[16] although
    they typically are 1.8–3.7 cm (0.7–1.5 in) in the wild with some variations depending on location.[13] Its lifespan
    in captivity is around two to three years, although in ideal conditions, this may be extended to over five
    years.[20][22] In the wild it is typically an annual species.</p>

<h3>Psychology</h3>
<p>In 2015, a study was published about zebrafishes' capacity for episodic memory. The individuals showed a capacity to
    remember context with respect to objects, locations and occasions (what, when, where). Episodic memory is a capacity
    of explicit memory systems, typically associated with conscious experience.[23]

    The Mauthner cells integrate a wide array of sensory stimuli to produce the escape reflex. Those stimuli are found
    to include the lateral line signals by McHenry et al 2009 and visual signals consistent with looming objects by
    Temizer et al 2015, Dunn et al 2016, and Yao et al 2016.</p>
