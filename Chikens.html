    <p>The <b>chickens</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild species
        such as the grey and the ceylon junglefowl <sup> <a href="somesource.com">[1]</a> </sup> that are originally
        from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
        cock is a
        term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
        capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p>Originally <em> raised for</em> cockfighting or for <s> special ceremonies, </s> chickens were not kept for food
        until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC). <sub>[2][3] </sub> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
        source of
        food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. </p>

        Their hobbles in the red wind <br>
        Burrowed himself down in the... <br>
